## Summary of Proposal
## Summary:

The Sustaining Open-Source Development Community Hub will explore how open-source teams are currently dealing with attracting users, engaging developers and raising capital for their projects.

It will explore the benefits to a culture of open-source development on Ethereum and the creation of public goods that can be leveraged by all. We will also talk about some of the challenges and impediments facing teams building open-source software on Ethereum.

Additionally, we will look at open-source development outside of crypto and try to understand what Ethereum can offer that community to make open-source development more sustainable and how to foster better relations with the broader open-source community.


## Motivation and rationale:

Open source has been a core tenet of Ethereum since its founding. Initially, most applications also followed suit, but increasingly we are seeing more applications with restrictive software licenses. This makes it more challenging for open source teams to succeed because there are less public goods for developers to leverage. It’s important for Ethereum to create a flywheel for open source-development where the success of one open-source project encourages others.

The Sustaining Open-Source Development Community Hub will be an important signal to the Ethereum community that open-source development is valued and to encourage new projects to develop in open-source. It will also be important for investors, many of which assume that an open-source project is not a good investment. By demonstrating the successes and increased investment opportunities, we can normalize investment into open-source projects and thereby increase public goods funding outside of just donations and grants.

The community hub will increase visibility for open-source projects and help demonstrate the value of public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

More than anything, the Sustaining Open-Source Development Community Hub will act as a central gathering place for open-source developers to share their experiences and learnings.


## Implementation:

The community hub will be open from 10am - 3pm every day. Each day will have a different theme but operate with the same overall structure.

Themes:



* Day 1: The current state of open-source development on Ethereum
* Day 2: Open-source business models and investing in open-source projects
* Day 3: Attracting open-source developers to your open-source project
* Day 4: Fostering better relations between Ethereum and the broader open source movement

General structure:



* 10:00 - 10:15 am - welcome and explanation of the programming for the day
* 10:15 - 10:45 - single talk given on the theme of the day
* 11:00 - 11:45 - panel discussion
* 11:45 - 12:15 - demos and highlighting public goods open source tools in Ethereum
* 12:15 - 1pm - Lunch break & meet and greet
* 1pm - 1:30 - single talk given on the theme of the day
* 1:30pm - 3pm - Demos, AMA and whiteboard session


### Additional Programming on the traditional open source community:

While there is a robust open-source community within Ethereum, there is much to learn from the strong tradition of open source in the traditional tech community. As part of the hub, we’d like to explore:



* Strategies to build an open source community - what industry organizations exist in traditional tech to foster open-source development? Could similar Web3 organizations be created? How do traditional for-profit companies interact with open-source? How to organize events that educate developers about your project? What other marketing and community outreach is effective?
* Open Source in Asia - a focus on the open source community in SEA and Asia more broadly. How does it differ from the rest of the world? What organizations and tools exist to reach local developers? What are the major events that projects need to attend to connect with open source communities?
* **Book club discussion **- There is a lot to learn from the history of open-source and we plan to host a mini book club going over two books, currently considering: The [Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar), [The Success of Open Source by Steven Weber](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674018587), and [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software by Nadia Eghbal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54140556-working-in-public). Attendees will be encouraged to read before hand to enhance the conversation. Other book suggestions also welcomed!


## Team

The hub will be primarily organized by the team at [Powerhouse 2](https://www.powerhouse.inc/) (part of Sky/MakerDAO). The Powerhouse team will be led by [Wouter Kampman](https://x.com/wkampmann) (former head of engineering at MakerDAO), [Kilgore](https://x.com/0xKilgore) and Lumen. We also have the support of other prominent open source voices in Ethereum, including:



* [Lefteris Karapetsas ](https://x.com/LefterisJP) - founder of[ Rotki 1](https://rotki.com/)
* [Igor Barinov 4](https://x.com/barinov) - Manager at[ Blockscout 1](https://www.blockscout.com/), previously at xDai
* [Scott Moore 1](https://x.com/notscottmoore) - Open source Enthusiast at[ Publicworks.fm](http://publicworks.fm/), previously Gitcoin co-founder
* [QZ ](https://x.com/not_qz)from [Ethereum Singapore ](https://ethereumsingapore.com/)
*  [Hong Phuc](https://x.com/hpdang) - cofounder FOSSASIA

We are happy to include [FOSSASIA ](https://fossasia.org/)in the community hub application. [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/) is an organization developing Open Source software applications and Open Hardware together with a global community from its base in Asia. One of its co-founders, [Hong Phuc,](https://x.com/hpdang) will be present and bring her perspective to the Community Hub.

FOSSASIA hosts [one of the largest open source conferences](https://blog.fossasia.org/fossasia-summit-2024-recap-highlights-of-asias-biggest-open-source-conference-in-hanoi-vietnam/) in Asia (this year it was in Vietnam and [next year it will be in Bangkok](https://eventyay.com/e/4c0e0c27)). They also have a chapter of FOSSASIA in Bangkok that can aid in the development of the community hub. They will provide a valuable perspective because they are not solely focused on Ethereum and Web3, so bring experience from open source in the traditional tech community. This will help strengthen ties with open source developers who may be skeptical of Web3.

FOSSASIA also can give guidance on what type of programming is most effective from events, sponsorships, blogposts to hackathon - what works?

Most importantly, FOSSASIA will give a local perspective, which is key for making Devcon and community hubs connect with the local community.

Equipment needed:



* Media team for content production Workspace
* Setup: Stage, AV equipment, booths w/ TV screens, chairs, whiteboards, and power outlets
* Translation Services: Real-time translation services for non-English speaking participants to ensure inclusivity.
